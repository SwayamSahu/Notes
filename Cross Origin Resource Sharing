### General Overview of CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

**CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)** is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control how resources on one domain can be accessed by web pages from another domain. This is important because web applications often need to request resources from different domains, and CORS helps manage these requests securely.

#### Key Concepts:
1. **Same-Origin Policy**: Browsers enforce the same-origin policy to prevent web pages from making requests to a different origin (domain, protocol, or port). CORS is a way to relax this policy under controlled conditions.
   
2. **Preflight Requests**: For certain types of requests, the browser sends an initial "preflight" request (using the `OPTIONS` method) to the server to determine if the actual request is safe to send. This is used for requests with methods other than GET/POST or requests that include custom headers.

3. **CORS Headers**:
   - **`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`**: Specifies which origins are permitted to access the resource.
   - **`Access-Control-Allow-Methods`**: Lists the HTTP methods allowed when accessing the resource.
   - **`Access-Control-Allow-Headers`**: Specifies which headers can be used during the actual request.
   - **`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`**: Indicates whether the browser should include credentials (like cookies) with the request.

4. **Credentials**: By default, requests do not include credentials. To include credentials (like cookies or HTTP authentication), both the client and server need to explicitly allow this using the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header.

5. **Simple vs. Non-Simple Requests**: Simple requests are straightforward (like GET and POST with certain content types), while non-simple requests require a preflight check due to their complexity or inclusion of custom headers.
