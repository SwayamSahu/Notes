The TypeScript roadmap can be broadly divided into three areas:

Language Features: TypeScript is constantly evolving to add new features and improve existing ones. The roadmap includes plans for better type inference, support for newer JavaScript features, and exploring advanced concepts like decorators. You can find discussions about future language features on the official TypeScript GitHub repository https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Roadmap

Tooling: A major focus is on improving the developer experience with TypeScript. This involves tighter integration with popular code editors, enhanced tooling for error checking and refactoring, and potentially offering language servers for even richer editing features.

Performance: The team is always working on making the TypeScript compiler faster and more memory-efficient. This ensures smoother development workflows especially for larger projects.
