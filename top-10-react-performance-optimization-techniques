Here are some typical techniques to improve performance in React applications:

1. **Memoization with `React.memo` and `useMemo`**:..
   - Use `React.memo` for functional components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
   - Use `useMemo` to memoize expensive calculations.

2. **Callback Optimization with `useCallback`**:
   - Wrap functions with `useCallback` to prevent re-creation of functions on every render.

3. **Code Splitting**:
   - Implement dynamic imports and code splitting to load parts of your application only when needed. Libraries like `React.lazy` and `Suspense` are useful for this.

4. **Virtualization**:
   - Use virtualization libraries like `react-window` or `react-virtualized` to render only the visible items in a long list, improving performance.

5. **Avoiding Inline Functions and Objects**:
   - Avoid creating functions and objects inside render methods as they can cause unnecessary re-renders of child components.

6. **Efficient Component Design**:
   - Design components to minimize their re-rendering. Use shouldComponentUpdate or `React.PureComponent` to optimize class components.

7. **Profiling and Performance Monitoring**:
   - Use Reactâ€™s built-in Profiler or tools like React DevTools to monitor performance and identify bottlenecks.

8. **Optimizing Context Usage**:
   - Avoid frequent context updates and use context selectively to prevent performance issues.

9. **Using the Key Prop Wisely**:
   - Ensure that you provide a unique key prop to elements in lists to help React efficiently update and reorder elements.

10. **Avoiding Expensive Render Logic**:
    - Keep render methods simple and avoid heavy computations or complex logic during rendering.
